ABOUT (for portfolio)

I'm a self-taught JavaScript developer. I have invested my spare time in learning the ins and outs of front-end development. I enjoy bringing my ideas to life in the browser and challenging myself with new problems. 

I have built several of my own projects featuring advanced JavaScript concepts, responsive design and module bundlers. 

Having worked in the market research industry for the last three years, I bring invaluable experience in project management, building client relationships and excellent teamworking skills.

I stay up to date with the latest coding developments by listening to podcasts, attending meetups and 'reading articles'.

I would love to get involved in interesting projects where I can learn and grow as a developer
